## About

Prototype of a new game by Brad and Yotam.

## Local development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install [Tweego](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/)
3. Copy [Chapbook](https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/) 1.2.0 (included in this repo as the `storyformats/chapbook-1` directory) into your Tweego install, over the Chapbook 1.0.0 it includes by default.
4. Start local test builds that will auto-rebuild on save with `--test` and `--watch`.

   ```
   tweego -o main.html --watch --test src
   ```

   Open the generated main.html file in your browser to try it out. You'll have to reload your browser after you make changes to the story.
